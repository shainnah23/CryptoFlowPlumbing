# CryptoFlow Plumbing Store

**Author:** Shainnah

## Description

CryptoFlow Plumbing Store is a modern, responsive online storefront for plumbing materials and tools. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows homeowners, DIYers, and professional plumbers to browse, search, and add products to a cartâ€”all from a single-page application. Product data is loaded asynchronously in JSON format using a mock REST API (json-server).
