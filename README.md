# CryptoFlow Plumbing Store 🛠️🚰

**Author:** Shainnah 👩‍💻

## Description

CryptoFlow Plumbing Store is a modern, responsive online storefront for plumbing materials and tools. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows homeowners, DIYers, and professional plumbers to browse, search, and add products to a cart—all from a single-page application. Product data is loaded asynchronously in JSON format using a mock REST API (json-server).

## Project Setup Instructions 🏗️

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Install dependencies and start the mock API server:**

3. **Start a local server for the frontend:**
   - Use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code, or any other static server of your choice.
