# CryptoFlow Plumbing Store

**Author:** Shainnah

## Description

CryptoFlow Plumbing Store is a modern, responsive online storefront for plumbing materials and tools. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows homeowners, DIYers, and professional plumbers to browse, search, and add products to a cart—all from a single-page application. Product data is loaded asynchronously in JSON format using a mock REST API (json-server).

## Project Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Shainnah23/CryptoFlowPlumbing.git

   ```

2. **Install dependencies and start the mock API server:**
   ```sh
   npm install -g json-server
   json-server --watch bd.json --port 3000
   ```

3. **Start a local server for the frontend:**
   - Use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code, or any other static server of your choice.
